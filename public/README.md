## Introduction

Iridiom, a playful twist on the element 'Iridium' and 'idiom', serves as your portal to an interactive and vibrant world of English idioms. This project is close to my heart as it's the first coding project where I synthesized my back and front-end knowledge, algorithmic problem-solving, and creative thinking. 

Originally, this website had a Ruby on Rails backend but considering the static nature of the data, it didn't feel necessary to keep it. Hence, I made the logic in JavaScript and ported all the data to the front-end using React JS. This also gave me more flexibility and creative freedom for the UI/UX part.

The idea for this app stemmed from my love for learning. I have spent countless hours watching science-education YouTube videos from creators that make learning fun and interactive. I wanted to do something similar for people learning English as a second language (ESL). English can be tough to learn and to top that Americans use many phrases and idioms that are not obvious to understand. I love science and that's why I picked the idea of having a periodic table to be the medium through which to learn about idioms.

## Installation

To run this project, you will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your system. After installing Node.js, you can clone this repository and run the app locally:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/iridiom.git
cd iridiom
npm install
npm start
```

This will start the development server, and the application will be accessible at [http://localhost:3000].

## How to Use

#### Exploring Idioms

Each cell on our 'Periodic Table of Idioms' represents a unique idiom, labeled with a distinctive abbreviation. The cells are color-coded based on their categories for easy navigation. Click on any cell to uncover the phrase, meaning, usage, and associated tags of each idiom.

#### Search Function

Looking for something specific? Use the search bar at the top of the page. As you type, non-matching idioms will fade, leaving only the idioms containing your search phrase. It's a dynamic way to discover idioms related to specific themes or concepts.

#### Category Filter

Intrigued by a particular category? Use the category key below the table. Clicking on a category will dim idioms from other categories, allowing you to focus on idioms from your chosen category.

## Features

- Interactive Periodic Table of Idioms.
- Search functionality to easily find idioms.
- Category filter to explore idioms by themes.

## Future Development

Iridiom is a work in progress. Here's what to look forward to:
- Adding a plethora of new idioms to enrich the learning experience.
- Cleaning up the code for better readability and performance.
- Expanding on the element modals that define the idioms in the table for a more in-depth understanding.
